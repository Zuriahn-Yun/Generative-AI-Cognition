V1 and V2 Differences 
- V1 uses Scanner V2 uses buffered reader

V1 and V2 similiarities
- Both are well commented
- I dont think either of them greate a large n x n matrix they change the size depeding on the level they need to create 

V1
-Scanner is never closed
- Makes more assumptions about user input than V2

V2
-About 50 lines of code extra
-what are NBSP issues?
-It has more defense against bugs in the input whereas V1 makes a lot of assumptions about the input cases given
-Very much more complicated than V1, way harder to follow

When testing
java V1 < test.txt

It looks like V1 falls apart at larger fractals? Hard to tell with terminal size being smaller. But from size 2 to 4 dont have many issues and can be checked easily.
