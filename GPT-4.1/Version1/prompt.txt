I want you to code a solution to this in java Specification of the Fractal Problem For a given character o and the fractal at level (n) 2，print out the fractals at required levels in the range of n (n<=7). Inputs The inputs include multiple groups of samples. The first line is the groups of fractals m. The second line and after are sample fractals. Each sample fractal is described in four lines: the first line is the level of the fractal (n) to be printed, and 2nd -4th lines are its fractal at level 2. The fractal at level 2 is fixed to take 3 columns and 3 rows. Outputs For each set of characters specifying a fractal, print out corresponding fractal at n level; print a blank line after each fractal; and don’t keep extra empty space in any line.
